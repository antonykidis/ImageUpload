In this tutorial, you will learn how to create Asp.Net Core MVC Image Upload and Retrieve.

I've added a few tiny features to the project.
1. I have added the image thumbnail to each book.
2. You can click the image in the Images list. This will open the image in a blank window.
This is a working repository. Enjoy!

<strong>How to Open?</strong>
1. Download, or clone the project using gitBash, powershell, or a simple Zip File
2. Navigate to ImageUpload Folder.
3. Open ImageUpload.sln (You will need aVisual studio 2019) The community version is avaliable for free(google it)
4. If You facing problems try to update all the Nuget Packages via NugetPackage Manager (Packages Tab)
   Select all the packages, and click Update Button.
   
   Thank You.
