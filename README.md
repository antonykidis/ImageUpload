In this tutorial, you will learn how to create Asp.Net Core MVC Image Upload and Retrieve.

I've added a few tiny features to the project.
1. I have added the image thumbnail to each book.
2. You can click the image in the Images list. This will open the image in a blank window.
This is a working repository. Enjoy!
